# Bitcard

![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/z8vgVcf.png)

Bitcard is a Android application that utilizes bitcoinj to make it easy to spend and receieve Bitcoin! 
The current build runs on the bitcoin testnet 3, so the wallet currently does not support the main bitcoin blockchain

# Working Features
  - Easy Wallet Creation
  - QR Code Wallet Scanner
  - NFC Card Scanning for private keys
  - Price Index
  - Database storing of public keys

# ToDo

  - Nothing planned, however a lot could be done to improve the app. Feel free to fork if interested



### Tech and Refrences 

Bitcard uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Bitcoinj](https://bitcoinj.github.io/) - API for hooking to Bitcoin Blockchain
* [Google Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) - Easy serialization
